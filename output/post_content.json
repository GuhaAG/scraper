I have family still living in Roswell & Woodstock, extended family in Buckhead & Sandy Springs - and I visit once a year (usually) since I've left. So, where am I going with this post?

Most Atlanta residents are from tons of different and diverse places in the world, so you don't tend to see any one particular religion \"taking over the mentality\" so to speak. However, by moving into the city, what you GAIN is high crime (Atlanta has been ranked up to the 4th most dangerous city per capita by some studies), a horrible public school system, poor air quality, and so on. In other words, \"typical big city crap\".\nOk, so you move out to the suburbs to get away from the worst of the big city problems, right? Well, you gain others. Go to Alpharetta and as was mentioned above by someone else, the traffic and commute is horrible. Sliding over east a bit to Gwinett County (where so many transplants seem to move), and you gain traffic that is almost as bad as that on GA400 (Alpharetta) - the school system in Gwinnett is overburdoned with so many students many go to classes in portable trailers, and teachers struggle to keep up with so many immigrant students that up to 30 native languages are spoken in some schools.\nGo south of the city? Crime. West, perhaps? Well, \"Smyrna\" is rapidly gaining a Latino population and traffic problems of its own. Further still to Powder Springs, Dallas, or Hiram, and some might say \"redneckish\", and you will then start to find that \"very strong religious attitude\". Once you go far enough into the suburbs in pretty much any direction, you find much less diversity, and much more of the religious stuff - but not diverse religious stuff - \"Southern Baptist\" (the most strict and some would say most uptight of all). Sorry to sound like I'm knocking one particular denomination, but Southern Baptists DO tend to have that \"witch hunt\" mentality... (if they don't like something, they do their best to get rid of it), etc.\nIn short - Atlanta still for whatever reason has the reputation as \"The place\" to move to, in short due to the number of available jobs and growth. Quality of life however, doesn't seem to be rated by those who suggest the move, and it's wrongfully ASSUMED by many, that the growth/job market also equals a healthy quality of life. It does not. I moved to Atlanta in 1984 and back then it was a much nicer city. Since that time, literally every single person I knew in that first ten years (about 25+ people) has left the Atlanta area completely. All of them. They've moved to other cities thoughout the country and in each case, wind up calling me saying, \"Oh my god, it's SO much nicer here than Atlanta....\". The crime, traffic, and smog in Atlanta have increased to such an extent during that time that even I have moved about 25+ miles outside the city, and plan in the next year or two to just completely leave Georgia, as the growth and problems spread out too rapidly to keep up with moving outward still yet again every few years.\nThere are some folks who just love it here. I can only say I do not, and I have known those many people who left after living in the area for a while. There are small pockets of nice suburbia throughout the area, but I'm personally not content to live in a \"pocket\" that is surrounded by problems that are only growing at a rate of around 65,000 new residents per year (average metro area growth). If you have no specific jobs lined up and are literally \"starting over fresh\" with a relocation, you may want to consider places like Spokane or Bellevue Washington, Portland Maine, Portland Oregon, Wheeling West Virginia - all of which get high ratings for \"best places to live\".\n-I suggest you pay heed to his observations/opinions, as they ring mostly all accurate. In the end though I suppose it depends where one has come from if a move to the suburbs around the 400 & I-whatever freeways are a step up, or a fall down - myself, I hate driving in traffic, I value my lungs, and although I like choosing from 14 kinds of fish to eat for dinner from Whole Foods & shopping up the kazoo..at 50+ that step down quality-of-life is a no contender.

I am a (4th generation) Cuban American and my husband is Korean, and our son is thusly, bi-racial. I am very fair and blonde and look like a major gringa, but I'm still Hispanic, and I'm almost a little worried that the \"good ol' boy types\" might give us problems. My husband worries that maybe even the Koreans will give us grief, and give our kid a hard time in school--my better half has not been around any real Korean population since he left Seoul in '75, so he has no clue.\nI'm really gunning for Alpharetta--is it a nice place to live? I can look on a map and see that it is x miles away from Atlanta proper, but is it far away enough that you don't get all of the crime that is ailing the city? I would really appreciate an honest perspective on this.

I am a (4th generation) Cuban American and my husband is Korean, and our son is thusly, bi-racial. I am very fair and blonde and look like a major gringa, but I'm still Hispanic, and I'm almost a little worried that the \"good ol' boy types\" might give us problems. My husband worries that maybe even the Koreans will give us grief, and give our kid a hard time in school--my better half has not been around any real Korean population since he left Seoul in '75, so he has no clue.\nI'm really gunning for Alpharetta--is it a nice place to live? I can look on a map and see that it is x miles away from Atlanta proper, but is it far away enough that you don't get all of the crime that is ailing the city? I would really appreciate an honest perspective on this.

If traffic is a concern, it is going to be very different on a weekend than rush hour(s) on a weekday."}, {"date": "08-28-2006, 03:23 PM", "content": "I think you have lots of options. Smyrna, Chamblee, and Roswell are all very good locations with a strong equitable positions. I think it would be wise for you to also look into the Vinings, Mableton, and the Highlands. Your price range that you have listed will obviously yield different results in different areas. I would say that you would probably get more square footage for the dollar in Mableton and Smyrna. That's Cobb county so your taxes are decent. I believe your criteria of lifestyle, school district, way of life, and other mitigating circumstances will be the determing factor along side the commute. You see living in Atlanta, with respect to traffic, can be very tricky. You can live literally 9 miles from your destination and have it take you the same amount of time have you lived 15 miles away. All depending on the route and times you travel. The great aspect is that there are many ways to get around traffic in this town. I recall living in Miami and, if you have ever been, you would know that sometimes being stuck on the turnpike or I95 means your stuck. Nowhere to go no backroads without fearing for your life or no alternate routes. Well it is quite different here. I would also reccomend taking more than a weekend, although with the right guidance you can learn alot. I have a GPS that thing works wonders for me. I would also reccomend you get one if your vehicle is not presently equipped.\nNot only has Atlanta grown, but like tentacles this growth has spread into counties and cities in over a 100 mile radius of the heart. Gwinnett county in itself has seen monumental growth and has now established its own university. The first of its kind in over 100 years. The mass transit planned for Atlanta is also a direct reflexion of the City, its commissioners and its patrons.\nI wish you the best and feel free to contact me to chat. I love to share my education and knowledge. It is a great pleasure for me to release the burden of holding this information in Good Luck!\nSincerely,\nDavid M.

East Cobb itself has excellent public schools.\nAs far as I know, there really is no concentrated area for Indians in Atlanta, however, I know that stores that cater to them are in the North Druid Hills area (NE area Dekalb).\nAnother area is John's Creek which is NE of Atlanta has a high Asian population as compared to the rest of Atlanta, but it does represent people from many Asian nations.

Keep in mind the zip codes are weird out here due to the growth. Your in Dacula but have an Auburn zip code.

Again, Thanks for anything you can share.\nUtility cost.\nElectric is 9 cent per kilo\nGas is about the national average or a little below.\nUtilities depend on where you live. N. Gwinnett is Jackson Electric and Buford Gas. Others have Georgia Power and Southern Companies. Most power is equal. Overall it is 2nd in regard to lowest price that I have lived.\nMost developments, as a matter of fact, all of them I have mentioned have thier own community pool, tennis courts, etc. Hamilton has 2 pools.\nGwinnett County has Gas. Jackson County and some Hall has electric.\nGrocery stores are Kroger, Publix, and Ingles. Ingles is a small chain based in N. Carolina. A good Southern store, at least the Dacula store is nice. Groceries are on the cheap compared to Jersey and equal to Illinois. Produce is good since your in the South. Remember living in the Chicago area it was like eating hard plastic since it was all shipped in, not to mention expensive. Now milk and cheese on the other hand\nIn my opinon, Norcross and South Gwinnett bordering DeKalb County. If your on I-85 anything between Exit 99 and 103. Norcross is suffering from major gang problems. All you need to do is watch the morning news and read the Gwinnett Post, 9 out of 10 hard crimes have Norcross beside the article. Which is another thing. Want a good paper get the Gwinett Daily Post not the Atlanta Urinal and Constipation\nThe difference is one reports news, the other reports their agenda.\nGardening is good.

You will never know what Atlanta has to offer until you see for yourself. Whether or not you like Atlanta will be based on what you are looking for. I would just hate for you to come here and wish you never came. I am a 26 year old black female from Columbus/Cincinnati, OH. I got caught up in the hype of wanting to move to Atlanta so I moved. At first everything was cool only because I was caught up in the partying (which Atlanta has plenty of). After a year or two of that, I got bored. The things that I yearn for I can't seem to find here. For instance, I am engaged and one day I would love to have children but I would die before I allow my children to get caught up in the Metro Atlanta school system. I work for one of our county's Juvenile Court's so we deal with the schools on a regular bases and if people only knew what goes on in those schools. Let's just say there's not alot of learning. I personally feel that there is no diversity here. Sure there are many different races but diversity is more than just different races. It's about people, culture, foods, the arts, etc. These people have no clue. And what's so bad is, it's not the people from Atlanta, it's everyone that moved here. It's like they came here, drank the water and turned stupid. As for me, I plan on moving to Chicago next year and I pray to God in the future it doesn't turn into another Atlanta as far as many people migrating there. You may not like a place like that because you are from the south and it may be hard for you to adjust to the weather. Since I'm from Ohio, I will be fine. I hate the hot weather. The air quality sucks so bad here. I stay in the hospital because I'm always sick with either, sinus infections, bronchitiis (spelled wrong) or some other respitory infection(which I never had until I moved here). So the north or the west would be better for me. All I can say is that many people like Atlanta. I think it's only because they choose to ignore what's really going. This place is crowded and it can barely hold the people that live here.  As far as real estate goes. It's a buyers market but the affordable homes are crappy. They built them in 2 weeks! I do real estate investing on the side based on the hell that I got through sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.

Apparently some people on this thread have become completely disillusioned by their experiences here in Atlanta and I can understand that.\nThe first thing that people need to realize about Atlanta is that the glory days of the 80s and 90s when you could move down, get a job easily, by a large house for cheap, and have short commutes are over.  A lot of the areas that were brand spanking new in the 80s and 90s are run down as a lot of them were buit in an unsustainable manner and people either moved further out or moved into the city.\nAlso, another pattern that I notice is that a lot of younger people who voice their disillusionment with Atlanta are the ones who chose to move directly to the burbs.  I'm sorry, but the suburbs are really boring if you're young and looking for things to do outside of going out.  You just won't find it out there.  Just like if I were to move to Chicago at this point in my life, there's no way in hell that I would live in Naperville or Schaumburg--I would find a place in the city where there are a lot of activities, establishments, and attractions within walking distance, a short car ride, or a couple of transit stops away.  Atlanta is no Chicago, but you can enjoy many of the same qualities here in the city of Atlanta that a major city like Chicago has.\nAlso, it's way easier to meet people and find a sense of community within the city than it is out in the suburbs for the most part.  You will come across people from so many backgrounds, professionally and culturally.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing the suburbs.  But for a young person to not even consider moving into the city and moving straight to the burbs is insane.  There's so much character and culture within the city that I think a large chunk of the 5 million Metro Atlanta residents miss out on."}, {"date": "01-28-2008, 11:58 AM", "content": "I agree with south-to-west. I lived in Atlanta from 1991 thru 2006 and moved to Dallas,Tx because I was offered a job with the company that layed me off in Atlanta after 14 years. I now want to move back to Atlanta. I believe the key to living  a quality life in Atlanta is basically to live close to your job. I plan to buy a condo in Dunwoody (cash) and try to get a job within the perimeter. That is how my wife and I lived when we were there. We did not have to deal with the commute or traffic there. Yes, there is crime there,just like in Dallas,Chicago,or any other major city. The weather in Atlanta is much better than in Texas..

HOWEVER, there seems to be an abundance of jewish kids at the school, and a lot of JAPPY (Jewish American Princesses) at emory.  but, it's still diverse.  don't pay attention to the director about rednecks.. inside city limits, there are rarely any rednecks.  if anything you should get used to, it's the fact that it feels like 50% of the ATL citizens are black, and that's just not one region, but the entire metropolitan area-- not many cities are like that.  however, over time, you wont notice.\n4.  opinion of emory- emory is known for being rather apathetic on campus.  not much time spend on campus.  it's very much a commuter school.  you go, you park your car, you walk to class, and you go home for the day.  a lot of this is because off campus housing is actually CHEAPER than on campus housing, which forces people to go off campus after the mandatory freshman year of on campus.  undergrad life is completely different from grad life.  undergrad wise, many students stay around the local emory area and don't venture out much.  grad school, most students explore the city more and see what's out there.  atlanta is a great city to be in your mid 20's and professional career, but i didn't think it was a good college town.  whenever i go back now (i'm 25), i like it more now.  it caters to my age-group.  the campus is super nice, and the neighborhood is southern and well-landscaped.  the technology on campus is top notch, but in retrospect, all you needed was a **** classroom to get it done.\nhope you found this helpful.  goodluck"}, {"date": "10-24-2006, 12:41 AM", "content": "That's very helpful.\nThank you."}, {"date": "10-19-2006, 11:48 AM", "content": "Hello all,\nI'm considering moving to the Atlanta/Decatur area to attend grad school at Emory University.

And before anyone says do the research, that things aren't as cheap as we think. Trust me we have. A comprable home around 300K in Kennesaw for example, would run about 500-800K here in Miami.

We want a nice house with a yard and I'm not about to get into a 4K+ mortgage. Anyways, I won't bore you with the details, it's pretty much the same things everyone is complaining about. And before anyone says do the research, that things aren't as cheap as we think. Trust me we have. A comprable home around 300K in Kennesaw for example, would run about 500-800K here in Miami. Property taxes would be 10-15K and insurance over 6K. Basically its about 3-4K more a month here in Miami. While we can afford it, it would heavily rely on my current job. I would rather move somewhere else, take a 30K a year paycut and not be stressed out.\nWe have some friends that moved to Kennesaw about 2 years ago. We went there last year when we started looking at moving out of Miami and let me tell you we loved the area. It wasn't too far from the city. It had some highways close by. Mall, movie theatre, chain stores, all close by. Basically everything we were used to having near by back home. Some of the restaurants we like to go to like Houston's and Cheesecake Factory are a bit far (in the city), but I think it's something we can deal with. We're going again in November to check some more areas out, and check out the city. Maybe drive during rush hour to see how it really is.\nI've been reading the forum for the past couple of days.

I am, although curious as to why you find it hard to believe, if you can't find figures? Interesting.\nWell I the reason I couldn't find figures is because I only spent about 30 seconds looking for info.  The reason I found it hard to believe was by simply thinking about it, it just doesn't seem right.  The 80% black for the area would mean only 20% of people in the Atlanta area are non-black.  That would mean 4 out of every 5 people you see everyday would be black.  I'm sorry but this just doesn't seem right.  I just don't see that many black people.  You lived in the Atlanta area, do you remember the mass majority of people you meet being black?  If so I guess we have had different experiences.\nNow on the other hand the articles you are talking about seem pretty accurate but some aren't refering to the Atlanta area.  For instance the wikipedia article about Atlanta says 61%.  The US census seems to back that number up so I think it is probably pretty accurate.  But 61% is only for Atlanta.  Not the Atlanta area which is what you were talking about.  The article saying Atlanta has one of the largest black populations is also probably accurate.  However, this article is refering to the Atlanta area but Atlanta is also one of the largest metro areas in the US (currently 9th according to the census) so you would expect it to have a large black and probably a large white, hispanic, asian, etc. population also.  That article doesn't tell you anything about the percentages.  I looking around a little more and most numbers seem to hover right around a 30% black population for the area.  The US census puts the 2003 estimate at 29.03%.  These numbers seem a little better to me, what do you think?\nhttp://www.census.gov/acs/www/Products/Profiles/Chg/2003/ACS/Tabular/380/38000US05201.htm (broken link)"}, {"date": "10-29-2006, 03:43 PM", "content": "The American Factfinder subset of the Census Bureau's webpage gives detailed demographic profiles of states, counties, metro areas, and cities with a population of over 65,000.

The Atlanta Metro area as a whole is approximately 57% White, 30% Black, 9% Hispanic and 4% Asian.\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/servlet...t=fph&pgsl=010\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/servlet...elect&-format=\nAs far as the original question posted in this thread, I have to say that during my time in Atlanta I was surprised by just how few interracial couples I saw.  I have no idea if statistics back up my perceptions, but generally it seemed to me (as unscientific as this is) if you were to walk into a mall, which generally offers a good broad cross-section of a community, out of every 100 couples I'd see, maybe four or five in Atlanta would be interracial couples (usually black man/white woman or white man/Asian woman) whereas where I live now in the DC area, I'd say probably 20-25 couples out of 100 I'd pass are interracial.  Again, this is just my own perception, but the dearth of interracial couples it was noticeable to me.  In fact, I rarely ever notice interracial couples elsewhere but while in Atlanta, it would catch my eye just because it wasn't that common of a sight.  Now whether or not these couples encounter prejudice or stares and such, I can't really say.  Well, stares and hushed whispers in some quarters I'm sure, but whether this leads to actual mistreatment and prejudice, I'm not certain.  I would hope not but I can't say for sure.  I was single for the duration of my time down there so I can't speak from experience but I went out on a non-romantic dinner date with a co-worker once (I'm white, she's black) to a restaurant where the patrons were predominantly black and \"felt\" quite a few stares.  As a whole, I actually found Atlanta to be fairly socially segregated.  People live and work and go to school together, which is good, but when you see people out with their friends at the movies or a restaurant or a \"girls night out\", it seemed that they were almost always with people of the same race."}, {"date": "10-29-2006, 04:16 PM", "content": "Hello -\nRe: \"The 80% black for the area would mean only 20% of people in the Atlanta area are non-black.

Depends on where you live & where you work & where you go for recreation & your friends, I suppose.\n1. When I lived in Marietta (Franklin Rd.), several hundred apts in my complex were occupied by blacks. There was 1 \"white bldg\" with 8 units. How many total units? I don't know, but it was close to 300. Where I worked in Marietta, yes, 4 out of 5 were blacks. Nightlife? I lived in a predominately black area, anywhere I went was predominately black.\n2. When I lived on the border of Marietta/Woodstock, the subdivision where I lived, the above #'s were reversed. Where I worked in downtown Atlanta, 3 out of 5 I saw/worked with, I'd say as a rough figure, were black. Perhaps 4 out of 5, now that I think of it. 80-ish employees total, since you seem to like #'s & %'s. 20-ish were gay, for a further figure.\n3. When living in Roswell, the figures in #2 as to where I lived, were the same. The figures in #2 as to where I worked, were the same. I then moved to a job where I worked only with Asians & I was the only white. What's the % of Asians in Atlanta? I don't know. Total 20 employees at that job. My last job was with Hispanic/Asian women & I was 1 of 2 white women. 10 employees total, if that makes a difference to you. How many Hispanics in Atlanta? I don't know.\nSo, overall, I came across more blacks in Atlanta, during my 5-6 yrs in living there. As for working, I worked at most jobs with either blacks/Asians & several jobs with mainly whites -by 80% I'd say. As far as nightlife, it was normally a mixed crowd, I'd say 60% white.\nRe: \"Now on the other hand the articles you are talking about seem pretty accurate but some aren't refering to the Atlanta area.

This is no longer the case. In 2002 there were close to 500,000 Latinos and these numbers are thought to be significantly larger due to underreporting. Latino immigration has transformed the region in a number of ways. The residential and commercial real estate boom of the last decade would not have been possible without the influx of Latino laborers. The result has been a growing Latino presence in city and state politics and Latino-run businesses. The recent state elections put a number Latinos in the state house and on various city councils. The black-white dichotomy that has historically defined Atlanta politics is triangulating to include the political, cultural, and economic concerns of Latinos. The ranks of Atlanta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asian population have swelled to double their numbers a decade ago to over 175,000 residents.\""}, {"date": "10-29-2006, 08:29 PM", "content": "Actually 3 out of 5 would be 60%.

The city of Atlanta is about 450,000 people or about 1/10 the size of the metro area.  For example the Wikipedia article that says 61% is only talking about the city of Atlanta which isn\u2019t very representative of the Atlanta area which most people relocating are interested in.  When somebody says the Atlanta area they are usually talking about an area that includes at least Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Gwinnett and Clayton Counties and usually several more.  This area has about 4.5 million people.  Long story short:  Atlanta means city of Atlanta, Atlanta area means metro area.\nI\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t a lot of blacks in Atlanta, but it is a little more diverse then 80%.  Of course it matters what part of town you are in, some parts are probably above 80%, but most are going to be below.\nAbout the original question, Atlanta is traditionally a very segregated city.  The different races seem to get along very well but for the most part they choose to live in different areas.  You shouldn\u2019t have much trouble fitting in but you aren\u2019t likely to have a lot of diversity in your neighborhood.  You are going to find a lot more diversity in Gwinnett County.

That article doesn't tell you anything about the percentages.  I looking around a little more and most numbers seem to hover right around a 30% black population for the area.  The US census puts the 2003 estimate at 29.03%.  These numbers seem a little better to me, what do you think?\nhttp://www.census.gov/acs/www/Products/Profiles/Chg/2003/ACS/Tabular/380/38000US05201.htm (broken link)"}, {"date": "10-29-2006, 03:43 PM", "content": "The American Factfinder subset of the Census Bureau's webpage gives detailed demographic profiles of states, counties, metro areas, and cities with a population of over 65,000.  The data is from mid-July 2005.  It's data shows the city of Atlanta as being 58.6% Black, 4.7% Hispanic, 2.0% Asian and 1.1% Multiracial. The Atlanta Metro area as a whole is approximately 57% White, 30% Black, 9% Hispanic and 4% Asian.\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/servlet...t=fph&pgsl=010\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/servlet...elect&-format=\nAs far as the original question posted in this thread, I have to say that during my time in Atlanta I was surprised by just how few interracial couples I saw.  I have no idea if statistics back up my perceptions, but generally it seemed to me (as unscientific as this is) if you were to walk into a mall, which generally offers a good broad cross-section of a community, out of every 100 couples I'd see, maybe four or five in Atlanta would be interracial couples (usually black man/white woman or white man/Asian woman) whereas where I live now in the DC area, I'd say probably 20-25 couples out of 100 I'd pass are interracial.  Again, this is just my own perception, but the dearth of interracial couples it was noticeable to me.  In fact, I rarely ever notice interracial couples elsewhere but while in Atlanta, it would catch my eye just because it wasn't that common of a sight.  Now whether or not these couples encounter prejudice or stares and such, I can't really say.  Well, stares and hushed whispers in some quarters I'm sure, but whether this leads to actual mistreatment and prejudice, I'm not certain.  I would hope not but I can't say for sure.  I was single for the duration of my time down there so I can't speak from experience but I went out on a non-romantic dinner date with a co-worker once (I'm white, she's black) to a restaurant where the patrons were predominantly black and \"felt\" quite a few stares.  As a whole, I actually found Atlanta to be fairly socially segregated.  People live and work and go to school together, which is good, but when you see people out with their friends at the movies or a restaurant or a \"girls night out\", it seemed that they were almost always with people of the same race."}, {"date": "10-29-2006, 04:16 PM", "content": "Hello -\nRe: \"The 80% black for the area would mean only 20% of people in the Atlanta area are non-black. That would mean 4 out of every 5 people you see everyday would be black. I'm sorry but this just doesn't seem right. I just don't see that many black people. You lived in the Atlanta area, do you remember the mass majority of people you meet being black?  If so I guess we have had different experiences.\"\n4 out of 5? No. 3 out of 5? Yes. Depends on where you live & where you work & where you go for recreation & your friends, I suppose.\n1. When I lived in Marietta (Franklin Rd.), several hundred apts in my complex were occupied by blacks. There was 1 \"white bldg\" with 8 units. How many total units? I don't know, but it was close to 300. Where I worked in Marietta, yes, 4 out of 5 were blacks. Nightlife? I lived in a predominately black area, anywhere I went was predominately black.\n2. When I lived on the border of Marietta/Woodstock, the subdivision where I lived, the above #'s were reversed. Where I worked in downtown Atlanta, 3 out of 5 I saw/worked with, I'd say as a rough figure, were black. Perhaps 4 out of 5, now that I think of it. 80-ish employees total, since you seem to like #'s & %'s. 20-ish were gay, for a further figure.\n3. When living in Roswell, the figures in #2 as to where I lived, were the same. The figures in #2 as to where I worked, were the same. I then moved to a job where I worked only with Asians & I was the only white. What's the % of Asians in Atlanta? I don't know. Total 20 employees at that job. My last job was with Hispanic/Asian women & I was 1 of 2 white women. 10 employees total, if that makes a difference to you. How many Hispanics in Atlanta? I don't know.\nSo, overall, I came across more blacks in Atlanta, during my 5-6 yrs in living there. As for working, I worked at most jobs with either blacks/Asians & several jobs with mainly whites -by 80% I'd say. As far as nightlife, it was normally a mixed crowd, I'd say 60% white.\nRe: \"Now on the other hand the articles you are talking about seem pretty accurate but some aren't refering to the Atlanta area. For instance the wikipedia article about Atlanta says 61%. The US census seems to back that number up so I think it is probably pretty accurate. But 61% is only for Atlanta. Not the Atlanta area which is what you were talking about.\"\nHonestly, I don't understand. I'm \"accurate\", but \"not talking about the same Atlanta area\"? I don't understand what you're saying, so can't respond. Those statements are confusing to me. You'd have to explain what the difference is between Atlanta & Atlanta area & how I'm accurate but not. Figures aren't my opinions/thoughts, but what I read.\nRe: \"I looking around a little more and most numbers seem to hover right around a 30% black population for the area. The US census puts the 2003 estimate at 29.03%.  These numbers seem a little better to me, what do you think?\"\nI never saw anything that said 30%, but if you're using census figures, then I'd say that's accurate. Never saw any figure below the 61% in wikipedia.\nI hope we're done now!\nYou can see how resources differ, no? Find the newspaper articles I referenced from 2005/6 which listed 80%. Again, go with the census figures, I guess?\nNonetheless, Rachel asked about a mixed couple (Hispanic husband/white wife). I was trying to be helpful. I have a headache. I'm not touching this one.

If you care to read the whole article, the link is \"http://www2.asanet.org/footnotes/jan03/indextwo.html\". Hopefully, local Hispanics or interracial couples can provide further insight.\nBest of luck with your research...\n\"Prior to 1990 the Latino and Asian populations were relatively small. This is no longer the case. In 2002 there were close to 500,000 Latinos and these numbers are thought to be significantly larger due to underreporting. Latino immigration has transformed the region in a number of ways. The residential and commercial real estate boom of the last decade would not have been possible without the influx of Latino laborers. The result has been a growing Latino presence in city and state politics and Latino-run businesses. The recent state elections put a number Latinos in the state house and on various city councils. The black-white dichotomy that has historically defined Atlanta politics is triangulating to include the political, cultural, and economic concerns of Latinos. The ranks of Atlanta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Asian population have swelled to double their numbers a decade ago to over 175,000 residents.\""}, {"date": "10-29-2006, 08:29 PM", "content": "Actually 3 out of 5 would be 60%.  Do the math.  3/5 = 0.6 or 60%.  4/5 = 0.8 or 80%.  3 out of 5 would work for the 61% from the Wikipedia article but those weren\u2019t the numbers which were originally stated.\nThere are a lot of facts and figures thrown around and people need to understand what they are referring to or they can get the wrong impression about a place.  If we are giving people relocating info I think it is important to give them as accurate of a picture we can so it\u2019s important that people really understand these numbers.\nMost of the articles which I have seen only refer to the actual city of Atlanta.  The city of Atlanta is about 450,000 people or about 1/10 the size of the metro area.  For example the Wikipedia article that says 61% is only talking about the city of Atlanta which isn\u2019t very representative of the Atlanta area which most people relocating are interested in.  When somebody says the Atlanta area they are usually talking about an area that includes at least Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Gwinnett and Clayton Counties and usually several more.  This area has about 4.5 million people.  Long story short:  Atlanta means city of Atlanta, Atlanta area means metro area.\nI\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t a lot of blacks in Atlanta, but it is a little more diverse then 80%.  Of course it matters what part of town you are in, some parts are probably above 80%, but most are going to be below.\nAbout the original question, Atlanta is traditionally a very segregated city.  The different races seem to get along very well but for the most part they choose to live in different areas.  You shouldn\u2019t have much trouble fitting in but you aren\u2019t likely to have a lot of diversity in your neighborhood.  You are going to find a lot more diversity in Gwinnett County.  North Fulton or parts of DeKalb can be pretty mixed also but Cobb County as a whole has much less mixing within communities."}, {"date": "11-01-2006, 02:58 PM", "content": "Hello out there!\nI am looking  forward to move to Norcross soon, I am a Bilingual Operation\nSupervisor and I will be looking for Job.

That's kind of a joke, but it gives you a pretty good picture of the area.  I am white so I can't tell you with any authority how bad the attitude toward a mixed race couple is, but I would be surprised if it was a big issue around here.  It's not what I would call \"bold and blatant\" racism.  That was L.A.!  I was shocked at the racism when I lived there.  I'd say it's more quiet and restrained racism.\nAtlanta is a city people move to from all over the world, very diverse.  Even here in Snellville you'll hear arabic, spanish, hindi?, african languages and lots of island patios every day.  So you'll have a large number of people who won't notice a mixed race couple at all mixed with some old south types who'll quietly dissapprove.  You'll certainly not be the only mixed race couple in ATL though.\nThere is some subtle racism though.  For example; the housing prices out here are lower than some other areas because there are more black people living here.  I was very surprised to have several people (including real estate agents \"off the record\") mention that to me.  We thought it was kind of funny in way though because no one ever said it with malice, just fact.

But the traffic in the northern suburbs is MUCH worse.  the north surburbs are whiter, way more crowded, more expensive.\n2. boring.  there is not much interesting in this area.  You'll be driving into ATL for that.  All the major chain stores are here in full force, but not much else.  It's an easy drive into town though.  We have found a few really great restaraunts out here after all this time.  We don't go out much so take that with a grain of salt.\nIf you have to commute at rush hour you need to think about your area carefully.  Smoke Rise is really nice and close to town for instance.

On the other side, the Black folks who are law abiding and taxpaying, church-going, hard-working citizens have been way too silent about this living arrangement.  They don't feel welcome as potential homeowners in the areas you mentioned.  While this is self-imposed, it's definitely part of the plan.\nI agree with you 100%, jewel: it's ridiculous.

They shop all they want, eat all they want, work all they want, but can't afford to live there.

There is a subdivision near my home in West Cobb where the homes range from $275,000 to $425,000.  It's about 35% (or so) Black.  Certainly not what I'd call \"affordable\" homes in my salary range, but it doesn't seem to be holding Black families back around here.  One reason however, is that so many people fall into the adjustable rate or interest-only mortgage scams, thinking they're getting a huge \"affordable\" home.  Minorities seem to go after these more than others according to a real estate agent I know.  Sometimes it works out for them, other times it winds up as a forclosure eventually.\nRegardless of how people are affording these homes though, I know there are still plenty of Black families in higher income ranges all over the metro area (we sell to many of them where I work).  Many of them however, do \"self segregate\" themselves into very high-end majority Black subdivisions in various areas, much the same way some whites do the same in other areas.\nAs one Black customer who lives in one of these places told me when I asked why they lived in that particular community...\nquote:  \"There's a lot of black trash in Atlanta.  That's not what we're [his family] about.  We live there because we're around other Black people who feel as we do about the problems in the city\".  - end quote.\nSo just like high income whites will look down at someone who lives in a mobile home and perhaps refer to them as \"trash\", it appears there is also class-segregation among Blacks here as well, who view the inner city Black community in the same way whites view more rural whites, etc.  It no doubt has an impact on home buying trends in the city."}, {"date": "12-17-2006, 10:38 PM", "content": "We are black (my husband and I) and we are planning to move to the Alpharetta/Roswell area.  These are the ONLY areas we have considered moving to in Georgia after doing our research. We've been back and forth to Ga several times..as recently as this past week. We were shown homes in Alpharetta, Roswell, Dunwody(sp) and one house in Canton.\nWe live in the Va/DC/MD area now and there are many affluent blacks where we live now and and we live in an upper middle class area that is predominately white. The housing costs in our area is outrageous when compared to any area in Ga that has been mentioned here! We can get our house or a house like ours in those areas for HALF the cost that we get here in our current area. We can even get a 'better' home in some cases.  We were very impressed with the houses we viewed there. Income isn't an issue for us--as our income exceeds the average income of the areas we are considering moving too.  We are only concerned with location, schools for our kids and a sense of community. We also like Ga because there are a lot of blacks doing well there---just like the area we live in now.\nWhere we live they just build large, luxury homes but the planning of the neighborhoods isn't done well.  There are just large homes but no sense of community.  Many of the areas we visited in Ga seemed more family oriented. You actually get more for your money---lots of recreation in the neighborhoods---which is something we are missing in our current area.\nWhen we were with our realtor---who is also black btw--she didn't make us feel as if we were 'locked' out of the areas we were viewing.  She actually talked these areas up. She did mention that a lot of people--both white and black people are not in a position to move to those areas in Ga.  She told us that we didn't have such a problem because our income exceeds most people incomes in Ga. Thats because we live in an area where the cost of living is higher and the pay is greater and our jobs or income won't change even after we move to GA fortunately. The people in the areas also were very friendly when we were viewing the homes. We received many smiles and waves from everyone (mostly whites).  We didn't feel uncomfortable at all. Then again, we are used to living in predominately white areas. It doesn't bother us at all...just as long as I can SEE some of my people (smile).  I don't want to be someplace where I NEVER see another black person. NO WAY! but I don't have to live with black people 24 hours a day..NO.\nThis topic caught my eye and I'm glad I found it.

I was glad to read your post, primarily because it's testimony as to why Blacks can live where ever we want.  Like you and your family, we looked at Alpharetta and thought that it had a nice community feel to it.  Not a large percentage of Black folks, but we didn't feel uncomfortable or threatened by it.  Every where I've gone, I always see at least one or two Black, Asian or Latino people.  Even at church--traditionally the most segregated hour of the week--we see folks who look like us.\nInitially, I was intent on living in Cascade, Lithonia or Stone Mountain for purely social reasons.  But in checking out those areas, it didn't feel like folks were about moving the communities forward--just sort of ... I don't know ... existing.\nDon't get me wrong; I'm not naive enough to know that a lot of folks in Alpharetta/Sandy Springs/Roswell would just assume we not live there, but there are plenty more who\nprefer\na little more diversity.

Dunwoody/Sandy Springs really don't offer that much value to the average home buyer.  Unless you are spending the really big bucks (say over $750,000), you will be making sacrifices to buy say a $400,000 home in Dunwoody/SS over say EAst Cobb, Gwinnett, N. Fulton and S. Dekalb.   You get bigger houses, bigger lots, newer everything and perhaps lower taxes.\nMany renters, of all races, after renting here for a while, feel as though the sacrifices that they would need to make to live in Dunwoody/SS aren't worth it and choose to go elsewhere.\nThat said, there is certainly more diversity in Dunwoody than 15 years ago among homeowners.

We currently live in Alpharetta, very close to the Roswell line.  We lived the majority of our married life in East Cobb and our sons all attended public schools there.  We moved to Alpharetta a few years ago to shorten my wife's commute to her office in Roswell.  I retired a few years ago.  I am a native Atlantan and my wife moved here with her family when she was 13 years old.\nMy favorite book is entitled \"How to Lie With Statistics\" by Darrell Huff.  It is an old book so many of the examples are outdated but the central theme holds true today.  In our media oriented, mass communication, grab the numbers as best one can society, \"things\" are often misunderstood.\nHere is a good example.  Crime statistics are frequently quoted on the basis on cities, as contrasted to MSA's.  The Atlanta MSA is approaching 5 million while the City of Atlanta population is barely above 400,000.  Atlanta has a huge daily and nightly influx of visitors from conventioneers, shoppers and workers.  To compare the crime statistics of the City of Atlanta to the City of Dallas, for example, which has a city population of 1 million is fruitless.  Still, folks do it.\nErgo, when I read the question: why aren't more blacks buying in Dunwoody, my immediate thought was: the same reason I didn't buy in Dunwoody: I cannot afford a decent house in Dunwoody.  I went to\nwww.coldwellbankeratlanta.com\nand ran a search for single family homes in the price range from 150,000 to 250,000 and got 1 home in the results.  One home.  If you want a decent home in Dunwoody, it will cost you.\nWhile it is easy and perfunctory to analyze demographic data for the number of blacks living in Dunwoody, perhaps a more useful analysis would be to consider the housing costs.

It's a free service to the comsumer, and it's great!! They will help you find an apartment in your price range and area, and they are so, so, knowledgable about the city and apartment communities. Check it out on the net. Just don't let them talk you into anything you really don't want. They get their money off the back end from the apartment community you chose after you sign the lease."}, {"date": "12-19-2006, 10:31 PM", "content": "thanks for the advice I'll check out the sites you suggested"}, {"date": "12-20-2006, 02:21 PM", "content": "Quote:\nOriginally Posted by\nGeorgia\n30044 You will be south of Lawrenceville and north of Lilburn.\nThis area is hot and cold.
